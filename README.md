# Arduino UNO R4 DAC Speed Test

## Overview
This project is designed to test the speed of the DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) and ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) on the Arduino UNO R4.

## Setup Instructions
### Hardware Setup
1. **Connect Components**:
   - Connect a jumper wire from A0 to A1.
   - Connect a 4.7k resistor from A1 to ground.

### Software Setup
1. **Upload the Code**:
   - Open the [R4_DAC_ADC_Speed_Test.ino](R4_DAC_ADC_Speed_Test.ino) file in the Arduino IDE.
   - Upload the code to your Arduino UNO R4.

2. **Monitor the Output**:
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE.
   - Set the baud rate to 115200 to view the output.

## Code Documentation
The code in [R4_DAC_ADC_Speed_Test.ino](R4_DAC_ADC_Speed_Test.ino) is well-documented with comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each function.

## Verification
Verify that the project is fully operational by checking the output in the Serial Monitor. The output should display the speed and resolution of the DAC and ADC.
